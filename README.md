# AutoML-For-Time-Series-in-Federated-Learning-Context

<pre>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for
training machine learning models on decentralized data. It allows
training on data residing on user devices, addressing privacy
concerns and data security limitations. However, selecting the
optimal model architecture and hyperparameters for each FL task
can be a significant challenge.

• Why Federated Learning?

    Traditional machine learning often requires
    centralizing data, raising privacy and security
    concerns. Federated learning offers a solution by
    training models on distributed data sets, eliminating
    the need for data transfer. This is particularly
    advantageous in scenarios where:
        - User data is privacy-sensitive (e.g., healthcare,finance).
        - Data is geographically dispersed acrossdevices.
        - Centralized data storage is impractical or infeasible.


• Project Objectives:

    This project proposes a novel AutoML framework for
    federated learning, aiming to automate the process
    of selecting machine learning algorithms and
    optimizing hyperparameters. Our framework will:
        ▪ Leverage meta-learning for efficient algorithm selection on the central server.
        ▪ Perform hyperparameter tuning on each client device to account for local data variations.
        ▪ Aggregate optimized hyperparameters from clients to the server for improved model performance.
